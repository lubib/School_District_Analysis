# School_District_Analysis
The analysis of school data using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook

- Overview of the school district analysis:

    The purpose of this analysis is to eliminate the altered data provided for Thomas High School ninth graders for reading and math scores.
    
- Results:

    After the data was removed there is no major difference in the district summary - the overall passing percentage is now slightly lower than it was. 
    
    After running math and reading scores by grade we no longsger see ninth-grade scores for Thomas High School, therefore it cannot be compared to other school's ninth-grade scores.
    
  Also, overall passing for medium school size (1000-2000) is now 85% which is 5% less then it was before we removed the data for ninth graders from Thomas High School.
